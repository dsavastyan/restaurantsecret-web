**RestaurantSecret — Frontend Application**

This repository contains the user interface and client-side logic for RestaurantSecret. It is built as a modern Single Page Application (SPA) that functions seamlessly as a web app, a Progressive Web App (PWA), and a Telegram Mini App.

## Core Functionality

- **Restaurant Discovery**: Browsing and searching for restaurants and dishes using Cloudflare-backed search.
- **Nutrition Tracking**: Interactive dish cards and menus with detailed nutrition breakdown.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login via email OTP handled by the PD-API.
- **Subscription Management**: Subscription-aware UI with integrated paywalls and feature gating.
- **Map Integration**: Interactive maps for locating restaurants using Leaflet.
- **Cross-Platform**: Optimized for both standard browsers and Telegram's WebView environment.

## Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Starts the Vite development server with hot module replacement. |
| `npm run build` | Compiles the application for production and prepares the `/dist` folder. |
| `npm run preview` | Locally previews the production build. |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Runs end-to-end tests using Playwright. |

## Getting Started

## Maintenance Mode

The application includes a built-in maintenance mode that can be toggled without code changes or deployments, perfect for GitHub Pages environments.

### How to Enable
1. Locate `public/maintenance.json` in the GitHub repository.
2. Edit the file directly in the GitHub UI:
   - Set `"enabled": true`.
   - Update `from`, `to`, `title`, and `message` as needed.
3. Commit the changes to the `main` branch.
4. The site will automatically show the maintenance screen to all users once the GitHub Pages action finishes deploying.

### How to Disable
1. Edit `public/maintenance.json` and set `"enabled": false`.
2. Commit the changes.

## Developer Bypass

If you need to access the application while maintenance mode is enabled, you can use the secret bypass key.

1. Find the `bypassKey` in `public/maintenance.json`.
2. Access the site with the following URL parameter:
   `https://restaurantsecret.ru/?bypass=YOUR_SECRET_KEY`
3. The bypass key will be saved in your browser's `localStorage` (`rs_maint_bypass`), so you can continue to browse the site without the URL parameter until the maintenance mode is disabled or the key is changed.
